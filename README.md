# flutter_uart_riverpod

UART handling code based on riverpod.
This code made with Grok3.
I need to talk to Grok for many times to let Grok know wrong behavior and errors and so on.
It's surprised that Grok, actually AI, works quite well and I realized that it's worth to pay for it.
I gave same request to oo.ai/perfectly/Grok and Grok gave more better answers than others.

## Getting Started

This is UART basic example code based on riverpod.
Actually I tried this feature and failed due to lack of knowledge about riverpod.
Riverpod has learning curve and it's not easy for me to understand it.
So, I made this code as a starting point for my future work with Grok and it's quite surprise than I expected.
